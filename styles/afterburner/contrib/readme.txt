     2. Style configuration
     
     phpBB3 style is configured as any other phpBB3 style, however we have made few little additions to the basic prosilver style. You can completly configure forum layout by changing variables in: "afterburner_config.html". Near the every option there is short comment explaining how current setting works.
     
     2.1 RokImagesetSwitcher
     
     Afterburner contains a java script for switching imagesets on the fly. When it's enabled, you don't need to install imagesets in ACP. Just select desired color variation in: "afterburner_config.html" and matching imageset will be automatically selected. Whenever you will find this script useless. Just disable RokImagesetSwitcher in "afterburner_config.html" and the standard imageset will be used.
     
      2.2 Color Variations
     
     We have decided to simplify color variations switching. You don't need to install separate themes in ACP. Just set proper style in "afterburner_config.html" and you are done.
